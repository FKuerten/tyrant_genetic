This file belongs to TyrantGenetic (the cli wrapper, but it applies to the whole family).

This one was created way after IterateDecks ceased to be maintained, however it is related.
It was created in May 2014 by Fabian "Praetorian" KÃ¼rten.

TyrantGenetic consists of some libraries and a cli wrapper, most of this is a copied from my modifications to Iteratedecks, however there also have been a lot of redesigns and improvements.
The libraries and were developed earlier for the other wrappers.
